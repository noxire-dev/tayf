# Worker-stream migration guide

Transitioning a deployed tayf instance from the legacy worker pattern (the per-worker `scripts/{rss,cluster,image,headline}-worker.mjs` processes orchestrated under tmux) to the new Vercel-cron + Supabase-Edge-Functions + pgmq stream system.

Architectural overview lives in [`adr/001-worker-stream-system.md`](adr/001-worker-stream-system.md). Read it first if you need the *why*. This document is the *how*: an ordered checklist for a one-operator deployment.

> **Scope:** production Supabase project + production Vercel project. Local dev parity instructions are at the end. The user owns the merge of `refactor/worker-stream-system` to `main`; nothing in this guide does that.

> **Ordering invariant (read once, obey throughout):** the Supabase migrations in step 1 MUST land before the Vercel deploy in step 4 — even an unrelated Vercel redeploy during a partially-applied migration window will regress `/api/health` (which now reads the `worker_metrics` view shipped in migration 024). Keep a freeze on Vercel deploys until step 1 is verified.

---

## Secret-handling preamble (apply before any step below)

The service-role key is the master database credential. Pasting it into a curl invocation drops it into your shell history (`~/.bash_history` / `~/.zsh_history`). Throughout this guide, load it once into a shell variable instead and reference it as `$SR`:

```bash
# Reads stdin without echo, leaves nothing on disk:
read -rs SR
# Paste the service-role key, press Enter. $SR now holds the secret for this
# shell only. Open new terminals re-read it with the same command.
export SR
```

Every curl example below assumes `$SR` is set. The Supabase project ref is similarly held in `$PROJECT_REF`:

```bash
read -r PROJECT_REF       # paste e.g. abcd1234efgh5678
export PROJECT_REF
```

---

## 0. Pre-flight

Confirm you have:

- Supabase CLI installed locally, **version `1.180.x` minimum** (older releases miss `--project-ref` on `functions deploy`; newer-than-1.220 has not been smoke-tested against this guide). Check with `supabase --version`; if you need to pin, `brew install supabase/tap/supabase@1.180` or `npm install -g supabase@1.180`.
- `supabase login` completed against the org that owns the tayf project.
- The Supabase project ref handy (held in `$PROJECT_REF` per the preamble above). You can read it from the dashboard URL (`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<PROJECT_REF>`) or from `supabase/config.toml`.
- The service-role key for that project (Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API), loaded into `$SR` per the preamble above.
- Vercel CLI installed: `vercel --version`.
- The current main branch is healthy: `npm run build` passes, `npm test` passes.
- A maintenance window. Article ingestion stops for the few minutes between turning off the legacy worker and the new cron schedule firing. Cluster + image-backfill have visibility-timeout-driven re-delivery so partial-state hand-off is safe, but the gap is real.

Take a database snapshot before starting (Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups → Create snapshot). The migrations are additive but migration 026 rewrites `content_hash` for rows already under the sha256 regime — irreversible without a restore.

If `supabase link` has not been run on this machine yet, link now so subsequent commands resolve the project without the `--project-ref` flag:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref "$PROJECT_REF"
```

If you cannot or do not want to link, every `supabase` command below also accepts `--project-ref "$PROJECT_REF"` explicitly.

---

## 1. Apply migrations 024, 025, 026, 027, 028 in order

These migrate the database side of the new system: pgmq install, the article-insert triggers that enqueue work, the content-hash unification, the SECURITY DEFINER `cluster_link_atomic` RPC that serializes cluster_articles writes under a per-cluster advisory lock, and the clean-drop of the never-wired `worker_checkpoint` table.

```bash
# From the repo root.
supabase db push
```

`supabase db push` applies all pending migrations from `supabase/migrations/` in lexical order and records them in the `_supabase_migrations` ledger. There is no first-class CLI flag for applying one migration file at a time. If you need a one-at-a-time apply (recommended on a first production run so you can stop on red), use `psql` directly and then manually reconcile the ledger afterwards:

```bash
# Optional one-at-a-time apply. Skips the migrations ledger — the next
# `supabase db push` will try to re-apply unless you insert the ledger rows
# yourself.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/024_pgmq_setup.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/025_worker_triggers.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/026_unify_content_hash_v2.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/027_cluster_link_atomic.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/028_drop_worker_checkpoint.sql

# Then reconcile the ledger so the CLI does not retry:
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  insert into supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version) values
    ('20240000000024'), ('20240000000025'), ('20240000000026'),
    ('20240000000027'), ('20240000000028')
  on conflict do nothing;
"
```

Replace the version strings with whatever timestamps the actual migration filenames carry — the CLI uses the leading numeric prefix as the version key. If you went the `supabase db push` route, skip the `psql` block above entirely.

**Verification:**

```sql
-- All three should return rows.
select extname, extversion from pg_extension where extname = 'pgmq';
select queue_name from pgmq.list_queues() order by queue_name;
-- Expect: cluster_work, image_backfill
select tgname from pg_trigger where tgrelid = 'articles'::regclass
  and tgname in ('articles_cluster_enqueue', 'articles_image_enqueue');
-- Expect: both
select conname from pg_constraint where conrelid = 'articles'::regclass
  and conname ilike '%content_hash%';
-- Expect at least one CHECK constraint enforcing length(content_hash) = 40

-- And the worker_metrics view that /api/health depends on:
select count(*) from worker_metrics;
-- Expect: a small integer, not "relation does not exist".
```

If any of these return nothing or 404, STOP. Do not proceed to step 4 — `/api/health` will 503 the new Vercel deploy.

Migration 026 is idempotent (gated on the hash regime); re-running it is safe.

### 1a. Expose the `pgmq` schema to PostgREST

The pg_cron drains in step 3 invoke the Edge Functions, but operators (and the curl smoke at the end of step 2) also need to reach `pgmq.read` / `pgmq.metrics_all` via the project's REST API. PostgREST only routes requests for schemas listed under **Exposed schemas**.

- **Hosted Supabase (production).** In the Supabase Dashboard, open **Project Settings → API → Exposed schemas** and add `pgmq` to the comma-separated list (the existing entries are `public` and `graphql_public`). Click **Save**. PostgREST hot-reloads within a few seconds; no Edge Function or pg_cron restart is required.
- **Local `supabase start`.** This branch already includes the equivalent change in `supabase/config.toml` (`[api].schemas = ["public", "graphql_public", "pgmq"]`). A fresh `supabase start` will pick it up; if you already have the local stack running, restart it with `supabase stop && supabase start`.

If you skip this step, the smoke curl at the end of step 2 returns the PostgREST `PGRST202` error ("Could not find the function pgmq.read in the schema cache") and the `worker_metrics` view continues to work (it lives in `public`) — the symptom is operator-tooling-shaped, not user-facing-shaped, but it WILL hide queue-depth problems during the cutover.

---

## 2. Deploy the Supabase Edge Functions

Three Deno-runtime functions need to ship: `ingest`, `cluster-consumer`, `image-consumer`. Each handler enforces an explicit bearer check against `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (see `supabase/functions/_shared/auth.ts`), so the deploys do NOT pass `--no-verify-jwt` — Supabase's edge gateway runs its own JWT verification on top, and pg_cron's payload (step 3) carries the service-role JWT that satisfies both layers.

```bash
supabase functions deploy ingest
supabase functions deploy cluster-consumer
supabase functions deploy image-consumer
```

If `supabase link` was skipped in step 0, append `--project-ref "$PROJECT_REF"` to each.

**Set the Edge Function environment.** Create `supabase/functions/.env.production` locally — this file is excluded by `.gitignore` (the pattern is `supabase/functions/.env*`; if you forked before that line landed, add it now and verify with `git check-ignore -v -- supabase/functions/.env.production`). Contents:

```dotenv
SUPABASE_URL=https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
# Optional: Sentry DSN (Deno-side SDK; populated when observability lands).
SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
```

Then push to Supabase:

```bash
supabase secrets set --env-file supabase/functions/.env.production
```

If your shop's policy is "never write production secrets under the repo tree", point `--env-file` at a path outside the repo (e.g. `~/.tayf-secrets/functions.env`) — the CLI does not care where the file lives.

**Verification.** Each command should return 200 with an empty-batch JSON body (assuming no work in the queue yet). The `$SR` variable from the preamble carries the secret; do not paste it inline.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SR" \
  "https://$PROJECT_REF.functions.supabase.co/cluster-consumer"

curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SR" \
  "https://$PROJECT_REF.functions.supabase.co/image-consumer"

curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SR" \
  "https://$PROJECT_REF.functions.supabase.co/ingest"
```

A 401 means the bearer check rejected the request — re-check that `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the Edge Function secrets matches the key in `$SR`. A 403 from the gateway means the JWT layer rejected it before the handler ran — confirm the deploys did NOT pass `--no-verify-jwt`.

**Smoke-test that `pgmq` is reachable via PostgREST.** This confirms step 1a took effect — if the schema is not exposed, the response below is `PGRST202` and operator tooling that reads queue depth will silently fail.

```bash
# $SUPA_URL is your project's REST endpoint, e.g.
# https://$PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
export SUPA_URL="https://$PROJECT_REF.supabase.co"

curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SR" \
  -H "Content-Profile: pgmq" \
  -d '{"queue_name":"cluster_work","vt":1,"qty":1}' \
  "$SUPA_URL/rest/v1/rpc/read"
```

Expected: an empty JSON array `[]` (no messages currently waiting past the visibility timeout) or a one-element array with a `cluster_work` message. Any response whose body contains `"code":"PGRST202"` means **step 1a was not applied** — go back and add `pgmq` to the Dashboard's Exposed schemas list, then re-run this curl. A 401 means `$SR` is wrong; a 404 on the URL itself means PostgREST isn't running on the project (unrelated to this change).

---

## 3. Schedule pg_cron drains for the consumers

pg_cron + pg_net live in Supabase but are NOT installed by the portable migrations (they're project-scoped extensions whose grants differ between Supabase Free and Pro). Schedule them once via the Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor.
-- Both extensions are pre-installed on Supabase Pro; on Free, enable
-- them under Database → Extensions first.

-- Stash the service-role key in a database-level setting so the cron
-- payload can reference it without baking the literal into pg_cron's
-- jobname (which is logged in cron.job_run_details, readable to any DB
-- role with usage on cron). The setting itself lives in
-- pg_db_role_setting, readable only by superuser / the bootstrap role.
alter database postgres set app.service_role_key = '<paste service-role key here>';

-- Drain cluster_work every minute. current_setting(..., true) returns
-- NULL instead of raising when the setting is unset, so the cron job's
-- HTTP request goes out with an empty bearer (handler responds 401) and
-- the failure mode is visible in Edge Function logs rather than as a
-- SQL exception buried in cron.job_run_details.
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cluster-drain',
  '* * * * *',
  $$ SELECT net.http_post(
       url := 'https://<PROJECT_REF>.functions.supabase.co/cluster-consumer',
       headers := jsonb_build_object(
         'Authorization',
         'Bearer ' || coalesce(current_setting('app.service_role_key', true), '')
       )
     ) $$
);

-- Drain image_backfill every five minutes (lower priority, larger pages).
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'image-drain',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$ SELECT net.http_post(
       url := 'https://<PROJECT_REF>.functions.supabase.co/image-consumer',
       headers := jsonb_build_object(
         'Authorization',
         'Bearer ' || coalesce(current_setting('app.service_role_key', true), '')
       )
     ) $$
);

-- Drive the ingest Edge Function every 3 minutes. This is the canonical
-- ingest entry point now that the legacy Vercel /api/cron/ingest route
-- has been retired — there is no other scheduled invoker, so missing
-- this schedule means RSS articles stop flowing.
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'ingest-drain',
  '*/3 * * * *',
  $$ SELECT net.http_post(
       url := 'https://<PROJECT_REF>.functions.supabase.co/ingest',
       headers := jsonb_build_object(
         'Authorization',
         'Bearer ' || coalesce(current_setting('app.service_role_key', true), '')
       )
     ) $$
);
```

Substitute `<PROJECT_REF>` literally before running — the SQL editor does not expand shell variables.

**Verification:**

```sql
-- All three rows should appear; `active = true`.
select jobname, schedule, active from cron.job
  where jobname in ('cluster-drain', 'image-drain', 'ingest-drain');

-- After ~3 minutes, this should show recent runs with `status = 'succeeded'`.
select jobname, status, return_message, start_time
  from cron.job_run_details
  where jobname in ('cluster-drain', 'image-drain', 'ingest-drain')
  order by start_time desc limit 10;
```

If you ever need to remove a schedule (for example to re-create it with a different URL):

```sql
SELECT cron.unschedule('cluster-drain');
SELECT cron.unschedule('image-drain');
SELECT cron.unschedule('ingest-drain');
```

---

## 4. Configure Vercel: env vars + redeploy

> **Ordering reminder:** confirm step 1's verification block returned `worker_metrics` with no error before redeploying. `/api/health` reads that view; a missing view turns the new health endpoint into a 503 and Vercel's readiness check can roll back the deploy.

Set the secrets and redeploy. The only Vercel cron after this refactor is `/api/cron/headline`; ingestion, clustering, and image backfill all run on the Supabase side now.

```bash
# Required — without this the /api/cron/headline route returns 401/503
# (FAIL-CLOSED).
vercel env add CRON_SECRET production
# Paste a freshly-generated 32+ char random string when prompted.

# Required — the headline route reads this directly. There is no OpenAI
# or Google integration; the route calls Anthropic's API and short-
# circuits to `{ skipped: true }` when the key is missing. Set it.
vercel env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY production

vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL production
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY production

# Optional — Sentry DSN.
vercel env add SENTRY_DSN production

# Optional — LLM provider overrides for /api/cron/headline. Both fall back
# to the hardcoded vendor defaults baked into the route, so leaving them
# unset keeps the current behaviour. Set them only when swapping providers
# or pinning a different model snapshot without a code change.
vercel env add LLM_API_URL production
vercel env add LLM_MODEL production
```

### Headline-route LLM env vars

The `/api/cron/headline` route reads two optional environment variables to
locate the upstream LLM. The defaults are baked into the route as a
backward-compat fallback, so existing deployments keep working with no
config; set the vars only when you need to override.

| Env var       | Default                                       | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLM_API_URL` | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`       | POST endpoint for the messages-shaped completion call.                |
| `LLM_MODEL`   | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`                   | Model identifier sent in the request body's `model` field.            |

The route still calls `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the bearer-style
`x-api-key` header and short-circuits to `{ skipped: true }` when it is
missing; swapping providers without also swapping the auth header shape
will require a small code change in `rewriteClusterHeadline`.

Trigger a deploy:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

After this deploy, Vercel's Cron Jobs page should list **only** `/api/cron/headline` (every 5 minutes). The legacy `/api/cron/ingest`, `/api/cron/cluster`, and `/api/cron/backfill-images` routes were removed in the worker-stream refactor commit set; if you see them in the dashboard, an older deploy is still being served — wait for the new build to propagate or roll forward manually.

**Verification.** `$SR` is the Supabase service-role key from the preamble; the Vercel `CRON_SECRET` is a separate value. Hold the cron secret in `$CRON_SECRET` for the same shell-history reason:

```bash
read -rs CRON_SECRET
export CRON_SECRET

# Should return 401 because no auth header is sent.
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  "https://<your-tayf-domain>/api/cron/headline"
# Expect: 401

# Should return 200 with a small JSON status payload.
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://<your-tayf-domain>/api/cron/headline"
```

**Trigger the cron's first tick manually** rather than waiting for the */5
schedule to fire. Vercel only attaches a cron once a deploy is promoted to
production AND the first natural tick lands, so a mis-configured env-var on
a fresh deploy is silent until ~5 minutes after rollout — exactly when an
operator has already moved on. The CLI shortcut:

```bash
vercel cron trigger /api/cron/headline
```

Older Vercel CLI versions (< 35) do not expose the `cron trigger` subcommand;
fall back to invoking the route directly with the bearer header (the same
call Vercel's scheduler makes internally):

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://<your-tayf-domain>/api/cron/headline"
```

Either form must return HTTP 200 with a body of the shape

```json
{ "success": true, "rewrote": 0, "skipped": 0, "errored": 0, "timestamp": "..." }
```

(the numeric counters depend on how many clusters were waiting; `success`,
`rewrote`, `skipped`, `errored`, and `timestamp` are always present). A 503
with body `{"error":"CRON_SECRET is not configured"}` means the env-var step
above did not propagate — see the troubleshooting note below before
declaring the deploy healthy.

Within ~15 minutes of the deploy, `/api/health` should report `clustering.lag_minutes < 15`. If it doesn't, see "Troubleshooting" below.

---

## 5. Drain the legacy tmux worker

Once the new stream has been live for at least one full cycle (≥ 15 minutes — enough for cluster-drain, image-drain, ingest-drain, and headline cron to each tick three times) and `/api/health` is green, kill the legacy worker:

```bash
# On whichever host runs the long-running worker.
tmux kill-session -t tayf-app

# If tmux isn't running, but the workers are loose as bare `node`:
pkill -f 'scripts/.*-worker.mjs'
```

Verify no `node scripts/*-worker.mjs` processes remain:

```bash
pgrep -af 'scripts/.*-worker.mjs' || echo "all clean"
```

The new system now owns ingestion, clustering, and image backfill. The legacy per-worker scripts can stay un-run forever; the source files themselves are deleted in a follow-up commit on `main` after Phase 3 QA signs off.

---

## 6. Confirm `vercel.ts` reflects the cutover

`vercel.ts` after this refactor should declare a single cron entry:

```ts
crons: [
  { path: "/api/cron/headline", schedule: "*/5 * * * *" },
]
```

If you see legacy `/api/cron/cluster`, `/api/cron/ingest`, or `/api/cron/backfill-images` entries in `vercel.ts`, the refactor was not fully merged — open `vercel.ts` and remove them, then `vercel --prod` again. The Vercel Cron Jobs dashboard should then list only `/api/cron/headline`.

(If you are following this guide on a branch where the legacy entries are intentionally retained as a soft-cutover safety net, the cutover is done when you remove them and redeploy. Coordinate with the QA owner before doing so.)

---

## 7. Smoke-test the end-to-end stream

Trigger a manual ingest and watch the work flow through:

```bash
# 1. Manually invoke ingest (or wait for the next ingest-drain tick).
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SR" \
  "https://$PROJECT_REF.functions.supabase.co/ingest"

# 2. Watch cluster_work depth shrink as pg_cron drains it.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select queue_name, queue_length from pgmq.metrics_all() where queue_name in ('cluster_work', 'image_backfill');"

# 3. Confirm fresh clusters land.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "select count(*) from clusters where created_at > now() - interval '15 minutes';"
```

If any step lags, jump to the next section.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `/api/health` reports `clustering` stale

1. Is the pg_cron job running?

   ```sql
   select status, return_message, start_time
     from cron.job_run_details where jobname = 'cluster-drain'
     order by start_time desc limit 5;
   ```

   - `status = 'failed'` with `return_message` showing an HTTP 401 → bearer header was empty or wrong. Re-run `alter database postgres set app.service_role_key = '<key>';` against the **same** database the cron jobs target.
   - `status = 'failed'` with `return_message = 'unrecognized configuration parameter "app.service_role_key"'` → you did NOT use `current_setting('app.service_role_key', true)` (the `missing_ok` argument). Re-run the `cron.schedule` block with the snippet exactly as written above.
   - `status = 'failed'` with HTTP 500 → bug in the consumer. Check Edge Function logs in the Supabase Dashboard.

2. Is `cluster_work` accumulating without being drained?

   ```sql
   select queue_length, oldest_msg_age_sec from pgmq.metrics('cluster_work');
   ```

   If `queue_length` is growing but `cluster-drain` is `succeeded`, the consumer is processing too slowly — bump the cron frequency to every 30 seconds (`*/30 * * * * *` requires pg_cron 1.6+; on older versions, schedule two jobs offset by 30 s).

### `image_backfill` queue is stuck

The most common cause is SSRF blocks consuming the visibility timeout without making progress. Check:

```sql
select * from pgmq.read('image_backfill', 60, 5);
-- Inspect the messages' read_ct. Anything with read_ct > 3 is poison
-- and the consumer should be deleting it — if it's not, that's a bug
-- in image-consumer.
```

### `/api/cron/headline` returns 503 `CRON_SECRET is not configured`

The route is FAIL-CLOSED on a missing or empty `CRON_SECRET` — every
invocation (manual curl, `vercel cron trigger`, or the scheduled */5 tick)
will 503 until the env-var lands. Cause is almost always one of:

- `vercel env add CRON_SECRET production` was run but **no redeploy** has
  happened since — env-vars only attach at build time, so re-run
  `vercel --prod` and re-test against the new deployment URL.
- The env-var was set on a different environment (Preview / Development)
  rather than Production. Confirm with
  `vercel env ls | grep CRON_SECRET` — the row tagged `production` must
  exist.
- The value pasted was empty (just pressing Enter at the prompt sets the
  empty string, which the route treats as unset). Re-add it with
  `vercel env rm CRON_SECRET production && vercel env add CRON_SECRET production`
  and paste a fresh 32+ char random string.

A boot-time warning lands in the Vercel build / function logs when the
route module is initialised in production without `CRON_SECRET` set
(`[headline-cron] CRON_SECRET is not set; route will fail-closed with 503
on every invocation`). Grep the build log or the function's runtime log
for that line to confirm which deployment is the broken one.

### Edge Function cold-start spikes

The first invocation after a long idle (Supabase scales these to zero after ~15 minutes) adds 200–500 ms latency. The `* * * * *` schedule on cluster-drain keeps the function warm; if you raise the schedule interval, expect more cold starts.

### Migration 026 failed mid-rehash

The migration uses a single transaction and is idempotent (per its header comment). Re-run it. If a row's `content_hash` somehow drifted to an unexpected length, the CHECK constraint at the bottom of the migration will fail; in that case, manually inspect and patch the offending rows before re-running.

---

## Local-dev parity (optional)

For developers running tayf against a local Supabase via `supabase start`:

```bash
supabase start
supabase db reset                         # applies all migrations
supabase functions serve                  # runs all Edge Functions locally on :54321

# In another terminal, drain manually instead of pg_cron. $LOCAL_SR is the
# local service-role key printed by `supabase status`; load it with
# `read -rs LOCAL_SR && export LOCAL_SR` so it does not appear in history.
watch -n 60 'curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOCAL_SR" http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/cluster-consumer'
watch -n 300 'curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOCAL_SR" http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/image-consumer'
watch -n 180 'curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOCAL_SR" http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/ingest'
```

Set `SUPABASE_LOCAL_URL=postgres://...` in your shell to enable the live tier of `tests/migrations/024-026.test.ts`. The local DB URL is fixed by the Supabase CLI defaults:

```bash
export SUPABASE_LOCAL_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres"
npm test
```

If you prefer to derive the URL from the running stack, parse `supabase status` text output (there is no JSON mode):

```bash
export SUPABASE_LOCAL_URL="$(supabase status | awk -F': *' '/DB URL/ {print $2}')"
npm test
```

---

## Roll-back

If the new system misbehaves and you need to revert to the legacy per-worker scripts:

1. Pause the pg_cron jobs (don't delete them — pausing is reversible):

   ```sql
   update cron.job set active = false where jobname in ('cluster-drain', 'image-drain', 'ingest-drain');
   ```

2. Revert the Edge Function deployments to the prior bundle. The Supabase CLI does not expose a first-class "redeploy previous version" flag, so the procedure is:

   ```bash
   # PRIOR_SHA is the merge base of refactor/worker-stream-system on main
   # (or any earlier commit that was previously deployed). Per-function:
   git checkout $PRIOR_SHA -- supabase/functions/ingest/
   supabase functions deploy ingest --project-ref $PROJECT_REF
   git checkout $PRIOR_SHA -- supabase/functions/cluster-consumer/
   supabase functions deploy cluster-consumer --project-ref $PROJECT_REF
   git checkout $PRIOR_SHA -- supabase/functions/image-consumer/
   supabase functions deploy image-consumer --project-ref $PROJECT_REF
   # Restore the working tree once the redeploys succeed.
   git checkout HEAD -- supabase/functions/
   ```

   If `$PRIOR_SHA` predates this refactor (i.e. the Edge Functions did not exist), deploy a no-op stub instead (a `Deno.serve` that returns 200 to the bearer-authed health probe) so the pg_cron pokes do not generate 404s while you decide whether to keep the queues idle or fully decommission them.

3. The legacy per-worker scripts (`scripts/rss-worker.mjs` etc.) are **deleted** from this branch (commit 7d84ece). If you need them back, revert the refactor commit set in git before redeploying Vercel — there is no way to restart them from the post-refactor working tree alone.

4. Migration 026's CHECK constraint stays in place (it's forward-compatible — the legacy worker also writes 40-char sha1 hashes). Migrations 024, 025, 027, and 028 also stay; the new triggers and the `cluster_link_atomic` RPC do no harm with the queues paused and no Edge Function dialling the RPC.

A *destructive* rollback (drop the queues + remove the triggers + drop `cluster_link_atomic`) is intentionally not pre-prepared because the user's instruction was *forward-only*: every recovery from a bad worker-stream deployment should resolve forward, not backward. If a destructive rollback is genuinely required, hand-write a migration that drops `cluster_link_atomic`, the two `enqueue_*` trigger functions and their triggers, the `worker_metrics` view, and the pgmq queues (`select pgmq.drop_queue('cluster_work'); select pgmq.drop_queue('image_backfill');`).

## Owner sign-off checklist

Before declaring the migration complete:

- [ ] `supabase functions deploy cluster-consumer` / `ingest` / `image-consumer` all returned success
- [ ] Migrations 024, 025, 026 applied; verification SQL above returned the expected rows (including `worker_metrics`)
- [ ] `cron.job` shows `cluster-drain`, `image-drain`, and `ingest-drain` with `active = true`
- [ ] `cron.job_run_details` shows recent runs with `status = 'succeeded'`
- [ ] `CRON_SECRET` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env vars are set on Vercel production
- [ ] `vercel --prod` deploy landed with the new `/api/cron/headline` schedule and no legacy cron entries
- [ ] `/api/health` reports `clustering.lag_minutes < 15`
- [ ] No `node scripts/*-worker.mjs` processes running anywhere
- [ ] At least one cluster created in the last 15 minutes (`select count(*) from clusters where created_at > now() - interval '15 minutes'`)
- [ ] At least one image backfilled in the last 15 minutes (`select count(*) from articles where image_url is not null and updated_at > now() - interval '15 minutes'`)
