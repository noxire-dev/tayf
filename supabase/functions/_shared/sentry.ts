// supabase/functions/_shared/sentry.ts
//
// Sentry instrumentation for the Deno-runtime Edge Functions.
//
// The Next.js side ships @sentry/nextjs (instrumentation.ts + per-runtime
// sentry config). Edge Functions are a different runtime (Deno 2.x) and the
// Next-side wiring does NOT cover them. The original audit incident was a
// 7-day cluster-cron silent outage that went undetected precisely because
// Deno-side failures route only to Supabase Edge Function logs which are
// not paged. This module closes that gap.
//
// USAGE:
//
//   import { initSentry, withSentry } from "../_shared/sentry.ts";
//   initSentry("cluster-consumer");
//   Deno.serve(withSentry("cluster-consumer", async (req) => {
//     // handler body
//   }));
//
// BEHAVIOUR:
//
//   * `initSentry` is a no-op if `SENTRY_DSN` is unset in the env (so local
//     `supabase functions serve` and CI runs without a Sentry project keep
//     working). If the DSN is present we initialise the SDK at module
//     scope so subsequent `captureException` calls don't pay a cold start.
//
//   * `withSentry` wraps a handler. Any thrown error is captured with the
//     function name as a tag (so the Sentry dashboard can filter cleanly
//     between cluster-consumer / ingest / image-consumer events) BEFORE the
//     error is re-thrown for the outer handler to log + 500.
//
//   * The `npm:` specifier (`npm:@sentry/deno`) is Deno 2.x's compatibility
//     layer for npm packages and is the canonical way to use the Sentry SDK
//     under the Supabase Edge Function runtime. No additional install step
//     is required — `supabase functions deploy` resolves npm: specifiers at
//     bundle time.

// Minimal surface of the @sentry/deno SDK we actually call. The full SDK
// type is broad and version-volatile; typing only `init` + `captureException`
// keeps the dynamic import honest without dragging in the whole shape.
interface SentryModule {
  init(opts: Record<string, unknown>): void;
  captureException(err: unknown, opts?: Record<string, unknown>): void;
}

// Deno's npm: compatibility layer. The Sentry Deno SDK ships as a standard
// npm package; the `?dts` query hint is unnecessary because Sentry ships its
// own .d.ts. See https://deno.com/manual/node/npm_specifiers.

 * thrown errors, so a handler that catches and returns 500 would
 * otherwise be invisible to Sentry. Includes the function name as a tag
 * so dashboards can filter by `tag:function:<name>` consistently with
 * events from `withSentry`.
 *
 * No-op when Sentry is unconfigured. Never throws — observability
 * failures must not change the request outcome.
 *
 * Round-6 P1 fix: every Edge Function had a top-level
 * `try { ... } catch (err) { return new Response(500) }` that swallowed
 * the throw before `withSentry` could see it; without an explicit
 * capture call those errors only ever reached the Edge Function logs
 * (which are not paged), which is the same blind-spot pattern that
 * produced the original 7-day-undetected outage.
