// Politics-filtered cluster fetcher used by the /clusters page.
//
// Perf history:
//   v1 (refactor-D) issued four sequential round-trips — clusters,
//   cluster_articles, articles, sources — which put the page at ~192ms
//   TTFB on a local Supabase. Over 70% of that was pure REST latency.
//
//   v2 (perf-2) collapses the whole read into a single PostgREST
//   embedded select that walks the foreign keys clusters →
//   cluster_articles → articles → sources in one HTTP request, then
//   filters in JS for clusters whose majority members are
//   politika/son_dakika. The returned shape is unchanged so ClusterCard
//   and the /clusters page need no edits.
//
//   v3 (perf-2, same pass) wraps the fetch in `unstable_cache` with a
//   30s TTL. The cluster worker runs on a 30s cycle so 30s of staleness
//   matches the natural data freshness. `unstable_cache` (unlike the
//   route-segment `revalidate` export) is honoured in `next dev`, so
//   repeat requests during the TTL skip Supabase entirely and drop
//   TTFB to essentially "React render time only".
