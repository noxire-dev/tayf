/**
 * Next.js 16 instrumentation hook (B8 / observability).
 *
 * The `register` function is invoked exactly once per runtime when the server
 * boots — Vercel calls it for both the Node serverless runtime and the Edge
 * runtime. It is the documented place to wire up the @sentry/nextjs SDK for
 * server-side bootstrapping (the client-side init lives in
 * `sentry.client.config.ts` and is wired up by `withSentryConfig` in
 * `next.config.ts`).
 *
 * We branch on `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME` because the Node and Edge SDKs
 * resolve to different bundles — the Edge build is intentionally trimmed and
 * cannot pull in @sentry/node's auto-instrumentations. The two configs are
 * therefore kept in separate files so each can import only what its runtime
 * supports.
 *
 * `onRequestError` is exported so Next 16's request-error pipeline reports
 * uncaught render/route errors to Sentry with full request context. Without
 * this hook, errors that bubble out of Server Components or Route Handlers
 * are only logged to stderr by the framework.

 * calls through every route.
