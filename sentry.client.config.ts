/**
 * Sentry SDK init for the browser runtime (B8).
 *
 * @sentry/nextjs picks this file up automatically during the Webpack build via
 * `withSentryConfig` in `next.config.ts`; it ships in the client bundle and
 * runs in the user's browser. The Node and Edge bootstraps live in
 * `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` and are wired up by
 * `instrumentation.ts`.
 *
 * tayf has no user accounts and no PII collection, so we keep the client init
 * minimal: no Session Replay, no BrowserTracing, just unhandled-error capture.
 * If we add an authenticated surface later, opt into Replay + tracing
 * integrations here rather than on the server side.
 *
 * The DSN is read from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` because it must be embedded
 * in the client bundle; `SENTRY_DSN` (server-only) is intentionally NOT read
 * here to avoid leaking a non-public DSN into the browser.
